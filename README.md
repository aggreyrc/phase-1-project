# phase-1-project

This is a project to create a Single Page Application applying all the knowledge acquired in phase 1 of Moringa school program.
The project requirements were as follows:

1. The app must be an HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API or from a db.json file using json-server. The API or db.json should return a collection of at least 5 objects with each object having at least 3 attributes. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.

2. The entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects or reloads. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

3. The app should use at least 3 distinct event listenersLinks to an external site. (3 events of different types) that enable interactivity. What this means is that, if you had 3 click events, that would only count as 1 distinct event and you would need to add at least 2 more. Think search or filter functionality, toggling dark/light mode, upvoting posts, etc. Each of your event listeners should also have its own unique callback function. These must be added using JavaScript's .addEventListener() method.

4. The project must implement at least one instance of array iteration using available array methods (map, forEach, filter, etc). Manipulating your API data in some way should present an opportunity to implement your array iteration.

5. Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.

    # E-BOOK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This is a Single Page Application that allows users to find and download books from a public api: Gutendex API

Its features are as follows:

1. Displays a list of books fetched from the api when the page is loaded. The user can browse through the books to choose a book they want and download that book by clicking on the download link that appears just below the book
2. The user can search for books by title or author.The user just types in the author name or the title of the book in the search field and the application will return books that match that search criteria.
3. The user can browse books by subject by clicking on any category. Clicking on the categories menu on the left will return books that belong in the category that has been clicked.
